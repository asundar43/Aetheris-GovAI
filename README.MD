Overview:
This project uses the AVS to securely authenticate operations and the Uniswap V4 Hooks to capture real-time liquidity events. The Gaia AI agent leverages available restaked ETH data to dynamically determine optimal liquidity rebalancing strategies, maximizing yields and enhancing risk management.

How It Works:
	•	AVS with the Othentic Stack:
Acts as the secure gateway, logging and authenticating every liquidity operation.
	•	Uniswap V4 Hooks:
Detect liquidity changes (e.g., new deposits, withdrawals, or market shifts) in real time.
	•	Gaia AI Agent (using restaked ETH):
Analyzes incoming event data, compares it against historical patterns, and decides if rebalancing (e.g., shifting liquidity to more profitable pools or securing funds) is needed. The AI agent then instructs on-chain operations to adjust allocations, all while utilizing the available restaked ETH to bolster security and yield.
